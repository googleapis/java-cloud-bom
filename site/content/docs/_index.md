If you are using [Google Cloud Client Libraries](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained), the recommended approach is to use the [BOM](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/bom) to ensure dependency compatibility.

This site contains Javadoc reference documentation for the latest published Cloud SDK modules. It contains the same content that is available on [Google Cloud Java Library Reference](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference), just in the standard Javadoc format that may be more familiar to Java developers.
